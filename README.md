This is an Exploratory Data Analysis Project for the course 'Applied Data Science with Python' from the University of Michigan provided by Coursera. 
For this project I intended to visually explore the relationship between GDP and life expectacy per country for 151 countries around the world, using data from the past 15 years.
The research question and the databases that I used are explicitly stated in the final report (the pdf document), alongside the final chart (scatterplot) depicting the relationship between the two target values.

I also uploaded the two databases in respective cvs files.
